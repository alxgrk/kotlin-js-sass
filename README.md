# Kotlin/JS with SASS Loader and hot reload

This is the smallest configuration I found to have a Kotlin/JS project 
which uses SASS and hot reload.

Launch gradle in continuous mode `gradlew browserDevelopmentRun -t`

You can then modify your Kotlin and SASS files and the see the result immediately.
